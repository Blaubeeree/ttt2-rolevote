# [TTT2] RoleVote
RoleVote is a addon for [TTT2](https://github.com/TTT-2/TTT2) that lets the players vote after a mapchange which of the roles they want to activate/deactivate.<br>
This addon is still in beta, if you find bugs or have ideas what I can improve tell me them [here](https://github.com/Blaubeeree/ttt2-rolevote/issues/new).
